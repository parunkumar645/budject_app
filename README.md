Budget App Project ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¸
Welcome to the Budget App project! In this repository, we'll guide you through creating a simple yet effective budget management application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Overview:
How It Works:
Our Budget App consists of two input sections:

Set/Update Budget: Use this section to establish or update your budget.
Expense Entry: Enter the expense title and amount here.
Upon setting the budget or adding an expense, the app dynamically displays an output showcasing the budget, total expenses, and the remaining balance. Additionally, a list of all expenses is presented, offering options to edit or delete each entry.

Project Folder Structure:
To maintain organization, we've structured our project folder as follows:

'Budget App' Folder:
index.html: HTML document
style.css: Stylesheet
script.js: JavaScript file
Implementing Functionality:
To bring our Budget App to life, we implement functionality using JavaScript in six steps:

Create Initial References:

Set up references to key HTML elements.
Implement Function to Set Budget:

Create a function to set or update the budget.
Function to Disable Edit/Delete Buttons:

Implement a function to disable edit and delete buttons initially.
Create a Function to Modify List Items:

Craft a function to dynamically modify list items.
Create a Function to Create a List:

Develop a function responsible for creating the list of expenses.
Implement Function to Calculate Expenses and Balance:

Create a function to calculate total expenses and the remaining balance.
